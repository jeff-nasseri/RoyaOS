# RoyaOS: An Operating System for Roya AGI

RoyaOS is an operating system designed specifically for hosting and running Roya AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Built on the principles of AIOS (AI Agent Operating System), RoyaOS provides a robust, secure, and efficient environment for AGI operations.

## Overview

RoyaOS serves as the foundation for running Roya AGI, providing essential system services, resource management, and interfaces for AGI operations. It is designed to meet the specific requirements of Roya AGI while leveraging the architectural concepts from AIOS.

### Key Features

- **AGI-Optimized Kernel**: A Rust-based kernel designed specifically for AGI workloads
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation and management of computational resources
- **Memory Systems**: Advanced memory management tailored for AGI cognitive processes
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with external tools and APIs
- **Security Framework**: Robust security measures to ensure safe AGI operations
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with increasing AGI capabilities

## Architecture

RoyaOS follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Kernel**: The core of RoyaOS, managing system resources and providing essential services
2. **Memory Manager**: Handles allocation, deallocation, and optimization of memory resources
3. **Tool Manager**: Manages integration with external tools and APIs
4. **Security Module**: Ensures secure operation of the AGI system
5. **Interface Layer**: Provides APIs for Roya AGI to interact with the operating system

## Relationship with AIOS and Roya

RoyaOS builds upon the concepts introduced by AIOS (AI Agent Operating System), which embeds large language models into the operating system to facilitate AI agent development and deployment. While AIOS provides a general framework for AI agents, RoyaOS is specifically tailored for Roya AGI.

[Roya AGI](https://github.com/jeff-nasseri/Roya) is an advanced artificial general intelligence system that requires specialized operating system capabilities. RoyaOS fulfills these requirements by providing a dedicated environment optimized for Roya's operations.

## Getting Started

See the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for instructions on setting up RoyaOS.

## Development

RoyaOS is developed primarily in Rust, chosen for its performance, safety, and concurrency features. The project follows a modular architecture to allow for flexibility and extensibility.
